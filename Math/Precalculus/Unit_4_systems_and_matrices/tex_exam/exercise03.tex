\begin{question}
Solve the following system.

\[\begin{aligned}
- 7 x - 5 y&=-55\\
14 x + 10 y&=110
\end{aligned}\]
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
The system is undetermined. Both equations describe the same line, so
there are infinite pairs of \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy the system.
Notice that ``infinite'' does not mean ``all'', \emph{most} pairs of
\(x\) and \(y\) are not solutions.
\end{solution}
