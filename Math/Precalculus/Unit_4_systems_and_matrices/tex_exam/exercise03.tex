\begin{question}
Solve the following system.

\[\begin{aligned}
- 12 x - 6 y&=-108\\
- 2 x - y&=-18
\end{aligned}\]
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
The system is undetermined. Both equations describe the same line, so
there are infinite pairs of \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy the system.
Notice that ``infinite'' does not mean ``all'', \emph{most} pairs of
\(x\) and \(y\) are not solutions.
\end{solution}
