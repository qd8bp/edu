\begin{question}
Solve the following system.

\[\begin{align}
- 12 x - 4 y + z&=-93\\
- 6 x - 2 y - 6 z&=-66\\
- 12 x - 4 y + 8 z&=-72
\end{align}\]

\end{question}

\begin{solution}
The system is undetermined. There are infinite solutions. This might be
because two planes are equivalent, or because all three planes meet in a
line, or because all three planes are equivalent.
\end{solution}
