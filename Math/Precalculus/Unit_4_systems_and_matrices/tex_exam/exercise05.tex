\begin{question}
Solve the following system.

\[\begin{aligned}
x + 2 y + z&=9\\
6 x - 6 y + 6 z&=-72\\
2 x - 7 y + 2 z&=-59
\end{aligned}\]
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
The system is undetermined. There are infinite solutions. This might be
because two planes are equivalent, or because all three planes meet in a
line, or because all three planes are equivalent.
\end{solution}
