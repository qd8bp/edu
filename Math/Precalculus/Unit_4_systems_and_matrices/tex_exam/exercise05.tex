\begin{question}
Solve the following system.

\[\begin{aligned}
- 16 x + 14 y - 14 z&=72\\
- 3 x + y + 12 z&=-6\\
19 x - 15 y + 2 z&=-66
\end{aligned}\]
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
The system is undetermined. There are infinite solutions. This might be
because two planes are equivalent, or because all three planes meet in a
line, or because all three planes are equivalent.
\end{solution}
