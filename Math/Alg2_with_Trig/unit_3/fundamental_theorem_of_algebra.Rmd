Question
========

Consider the polynomial function below.

```{python,results="asis",echo=F}
from sympy import symbols, Poly, latex, N
x = symbols("x")
po = Poly(list(map(int,r.cf)),x)
st = latex(po.as_expr())
```


$$f(x)=`r py$st`$$

How many roots, including complex roots and counting multiplicity, does the polynomial have?

Or, in other words, based on the degree of the polynomial, what is the most number of possible real roots?


Solution
========

`r deg`

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra tells us that the number of complex roots, when counting for multiplicity, is equal to the degree of the polynomial.

The degree of the polynomial is just the largest exponent, `r deg`.
