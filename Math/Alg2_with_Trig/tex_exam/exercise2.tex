\begin{question}
Consider the polynomial function below.

\[f(x)=- 2 x^{7} - 4 x^{5} + 8 x^{3} + 7 x - 6\]

How many roots, including complex roots and counting multiplicity, does
the polynomial have?

Or, in other words, based on the degree of the polynomial, what is the
most number of possible real roots?
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
7

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra tells us that the number of complex
roots, when counting for multiplicity, is equal to the degree of the
polynomial.

The degree of the polynomial is just the largest exponent, 7.
\end{solution}
